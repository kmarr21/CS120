                            <p class="dog-name">Dog: Riff</p>
                            <p class="member-bio">Eddie is the band's lead vocalist and natural lightning rod. His voice is raw, unfiltered, and unmistakably his — a product of years fronting basement bands and teaching poetry on the side. He's got a commanding stage presence and an instinct for turning any cover into something personal and gritty. When he's not performing, he's either crate-digging for records, arguing about B-sides, or hiking with his lab, Riff, who's never far from his side.</p>

                            <p class="dog-name">Dog: Ozzy</p>
                            <p class="member-bio">Jules is the technical powerhouse of the group — a classically trained guitarist who brings both speed and soul to every set. She has a gift for tone and phrasing, and she's known for intricate solos that feel improvised but land with precision. She grew up in Southern California, studied music formally, and eventually made her way to Seattle's live scene where she's become a staple. When she's not gigging, she's often camping out near Mt. Rainier with Ozzy, her co-pilot.</p>

                            <p class="dog-name">Dog: Snare</p>
                            <p class="member-bio">Cal is the most energetic member of the band — a drummer who plays with intensity but never lets the tempo slip. His background ranges from jazz to hardcore punk, and that range shows in his precision and creative fills. Cal's also a gear nerd who's happiest when he's talking about cymbal weight or rebuilding a vintage kick pedal. Outside of music, he works in bike repair and spends a lot of time in the woods with Snare, his black lab who seems content to sleep through almost anything.</p>

                            <p class="dog-name">Dog: Sabbath</p>
                            <p class="member-bio">Leo is the kind of bassist who says more with five notes than most can with fifty. His playing anchors the band, adding weight and depth without ever needing the spotlight. Originally from Portland, Leo studied engineering before going all in on music. He brings a methodical approach to arranging and recording, and handles much of the band's live sound setup. He and his dog Sabbath have been inseparable for nearly a decade.</p>
