        <h2> A Recent Trip I Took</h2>
        <p> Earlier this year, I went to the Azores, a group of islands far off the coast of Portugal, with 
            my mom and sister. They're volcanic islands, so we got to see some calderas and do some beautiful hikes. 
            The food there was also amazing: we did a cooking class with a local named Maria, and got to try our hand
            at making pastel de nata (a Portuguese egg custard tart patry which tastes a bit like creme brulee). 

        <h2> Favorite Pet Names</h2>
        <p> My favorite pet names and the animals I would give them to are, in no particular order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> An orange cat named Melon</li>
            <li> A great pyrenees (dog) named Hank</li>
            <li> A monitor lizard named Nostradamus</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <p> I lived in Boston for 3 years, and my favorite restaurant is still there, in Harvard Square. 
            <a href="https://www.aldenharlow.com/" target="_blank"> It's called Alden & Harlow!</a> 
            They serve mostly small plates, but it also has the best pasta dish I've ever had: a basil 
            pasta with a carrot bolognese â€” which may sound odd, but it tastes great! </p>

        <h2>Favorite Food</h2>

        <p>
            My favorite food that I prepare for myself is probably overnight oats. I keep it pretty simple.
            I use rolled oats, chia seeds, maple syrup, a little bit of greek yogurt, and unsweetened almond milk. 
            I combine all of these in a jar, mix, and then let sit in the fridge overnight. Then in the morning I top
            with fruits or any other toppings I think of (e.g., cinnamon, chopped nuts, etc.). And viola! Overnight oats.
